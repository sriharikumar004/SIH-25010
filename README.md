## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
To address the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers, we propose the development of a multilingual, AI-driven smart advisory platform accessible via mobile application, chatbot, and voice interface. The solution will combine advanced technologies with local context to deliver timely, personalized, and actionable insights.

Key Features

Soil and Crop Advisory

Integration with soil health databases and farm-level inputs.
Personalized recommendations for crop selection, fertilizer dosage, and nutrient management.

Weather-Based Insights

Real-time and predictive weather alerts to guide sowing, irrigation, and harvesting decisions.
Early warnings for adverse conditions like drought, heavy rainfall, or pest outbreaks.

Pest and Disease Detection

AI-enabled image recognition for crop health assessment through photo uploads.
Immediate advisory on prevention and treatment options with eco-friendly solutions.

Market and Price Tracking

Daily updates on local and regional market prices.
Guidance on optimal selling times and locations to maximize farmer income.

Multilingual and Voice Support

Local language interfaces and voice-enabled interactions for ease of use.
Compatibility with basic smartphones to ensure accessibility.

Farmer Community & Feedback Loop

Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing within the app.
Continuous system improvement using farmer feedback and real-world usage data.
Technology Stack
AI & Machine Learning for predictive analytics and pest detection.
IoT & Remote Sensing Integration for soil, weather, and crop monitoring.
Cloud Infrastructure for scalability and data security.
Voice and NLP (Natural Language Processing) for regional language support.
Implementation Approach
Pilot Phase: Deploy in selected districts of Punjab to validate accuracy, usability, and adoption.
Scale-Up: Extend coverage across the state, then to other regions with local customization.
Partnerships: Collaborate with government agencies, NGOs, cooperatives, and agri-tech firms for outreach and support.
Capacity Building: Train extension officers and farmer leaders to act as on-ground facilitators.
Expected Impact
Increase in average yields by 20–30%.
Reduction in input costs due to optimized use of fertilizers and pesticides.
Enhanced income security through better price discovery and market linkages.
Greater adoption of sustainable and eco-friendly farming practices.
Empowerment of farmers through access to localized, reliable, and real-time information.
## Technical Approach
The system uses a modular design with different services connected through an API Gateway.

- *Technologies*  
  - Backend: Python (Django/Flask)  
  - Frontend: JavaScript (React)  
  - Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis/Cloud Storage  
  - AI/ML: For pest and disease detection from images  
  - APIs: Weather updates, market price feeds  

- *Methodology*  
  1. Farmers use the *mobile app or USSD service* to raise queries.  
  2. Requests go through an *API Gateway* for routing and authentication.  
  3. The request is sent to the right *backend service* (crop advisory, pest detection, weather/soil, market monitoring).  
  4. Each service connects to its own *database* for storing and retrieving information.  
  5. The processed result is sent 

## Feasibility and Viability
The proposed smart advisory solution is highly feasible and viable across technical, operational, financial, and social dimensions. Technically, it leverages proven AI, machine learning, image recognition, and NLP technologies, while required data on soil, weather, crops, and markets are readily accessible from government sources, IoT devices, and remote sensing. The platform is compatible with both smartphones and feature phones, and voice-based interfaces make it accessible to low-literate farmers. Operationally, the solution can be piloted in selected districts with the support of extension officers, and partnerships with government agencies, NGOs, cooperatives, and agri-tech startups ensure smooth outreach and training. Financially, cloud-based deployment minimizes infrastructure costs, while potential revenue models include freemium subscriptions, premium services, or government/NGO funding. Importantly, the solution promotes sustainable farming, optimizes input usage, and empowers small and marginal farmers with scientific decision-making tools, enhancing both economic and environmental outcomes.

## Impact and Benefits
The proposed smart advisory solution is expected to deliver significant economic, social, and environmental benefits. Economically, it can increase crop yields by 20–30%, reduce input costs through optimized fertilizer and pesticide use, and improve farmers’ incomes via better market price discovery. Socially, it empowers small and marginal farmers with timely, personalized, and localized guidance in their native language, including voice support for low-literacy users, thereby reducing dependency on informal advice. Environmentally, the solution promotes sustainable farming practices by minimizing chemical overuse, conserving soil health, and supporting eco-friendly pest and nutrient management. Additionally, the platform creates a feedback loop for continuous improvement, enabling farmers, extension officers, and policymakers to make data-driven decisions. Overall, this initiative enhances livelihoods, strengthens food security, and fosters long-term agricultural sustainability.
